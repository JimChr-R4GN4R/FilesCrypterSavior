## To-Do List
- [ ] Add `Quick Decrypt Button` that checks if the file you want to decrypt exists in database, so it gets key and nonce from there directly.
- [ ] Add `BKP` (Basic Key Protector) system which means that user enters a key which he wants and database will be encrypted/decrypted by this key and files' keys and nonces will be generated automatically, so user has just to know only one key to encrypt/decrypt his files.
